## Overview
In light of recent of international issues such as the hurricane in Puerto Rico and the Venezuelan crisis, issues of lack of internet and electricity have become ever prevalent in news and media. In a world that is constantly connected, it is a shame that it is least connected at the times people need it the most. Crisis Connect aims to solve exactly that! It is a system that works to fundamentally provide a means of communication to those in disaster situations that lack Internet or Cellular connection.


## How it works
Using a mesh network of Dragonboard's (or for that matter any small computing node) Crisis Connect provides and expands the internet connection of one computer/user and spreads it to thousands of other potential users. This is accomplished through connections between a client/disaster victim's device to one of the hundreds of nodes in the system. The nodes effectively, through their mesh-like nature, relay a message down to an internet access point potentially miles away. This message is then sent to cloud based servers and made available through a web user interface to first responders.
